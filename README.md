Description
-----------
A simple Android application to perform calculations with weighted averages.

Operating Instructions
----------------------
Calculate a Weighted Average:

Fill in all fields, but leave the final mark empty,
and hit the Calculate button to get a weighted average.

Reverse Calculate a Mark:

Fill in all fields, including the final mark, and leave one Mark field empty.
Hit the Calculate button to get the mark you need for the final average you want.

Labels:

Labels in the top-left corner of each mark allows you to keep organized
and keep track of where your grades have come from.

Add and Remove:

You can add as many marks as you want by tapping the plus button in the action bar.
You can remove marks by tapping the garbage can in the top-right corner of each mark.

Auto-save:

Your marks will automatically be saved when you exit the app.
Press Reset to clear all marks.

Adapts:

The total % weightings do not have to add up to 100.
Weighted Calculator will calculate your final mark based on how much weighting
the current marks have received.

Precision:

You may input as many decimal places as you would like,
however, all calculations are rounded to two decimal places.
